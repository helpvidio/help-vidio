<h2>Here's what you're getting.</h2>

<p>
  Adding video to your help docs would be like adding phone call and remote access support to email support. It's just a better way of showing how to do things.
</p>

<h2>Why do I need help videos?</h2>

<h2>Why not make them yourself? It's not worth your time.</h2>
<p>
  I also want your business, but really it's not worth your time. It may seem quick and easy, but it isn't, something I learned the hard way when I first got assigned to create videos as an intern.
</p>
Here's some of the things you need...
<ul>
  <li>Audio and video editing software</li>
  <li>Audio setup (microphone, etc.)</li>
  <li>A quiet place</li>
  <li>Time</li>
  <li>Practice</li>
  <li>More time</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The bare minimum in equipment alone will put you out a few hundred dollars. The real cost though is time. Videos are a great example of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto principle</a>. Getting the video perfect takes a huge amount of time and effort. It takes practice, you'll screw up over and over before you finally get it.
</p>


<h2>See the difference for yourself</h2>

<p>
  On the right side I used no paid equipment or software, edited as though I had no video editing experience, and dug through my trash to find one of my first voice over attempts.
</p>

<p>
  On the left is the result of the correct equipment and a lot of practice, not to brag.
</p>



<p>From several hundred dollars worth of software and equipment to countless hours spent learning how to create the best affordable videos possible, it simply isn't worth learning how to do yourself.</p>

<h2>When your time is worth <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/value-time.html">$1000/hr</a> can you afford taking weeks off to make videos?</h2>
