<h2>TODO: Example videos</h2>



<h2>Help doc videos lead to happier customers and less support requests</h2>
<p>TODO: Statistics would be nice here</p>  
<ul>
  <li>Customers who prefer video to text will be happy</li>
  <li>Leaves less room for misinterpretation</li>
</ul>
    

<h2>Why not make them yourself?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Equipment cost</li>
  <li>Takes a lot of time and practice - pareto priciple</li>
  <li>Not worth time of founder or skilled employees</li>
</ul>

<p>Still want to do them yourself? Here's a blog post detailing the process</p>

<p>TODO: Have a page going into further detail about how videos are a pain and not worth the time</p>

<p>

<h2>TODO: Good videos versus bad video</h2>

<h2>The Process</h2>
<ol class="process">
  <li>Fill out the order form and get a quote</li>
  <li>Pay 50% up front</li>
  <li>Fill out a form giving any further information</li>
  <li>I take your help docs and make them scripts staying as close to word for word as possible</li>
  <li>I upload your videos in Cage where you'll be able to offer feedback</li>
  <li>You like the videos and pay the final 50%</li>
  <li>I setup video hosting on your app of choice and upload/deliver the videos. (or just send the videos if preferred)</li>
</ol>

<h2>TODO: Case studies and testimonials</h2>

<h2>Pricing</h2>

<p>$150 for your first video, $100 for every video after</p>


<p>The first video costs more because of the initial setup time it takes to get rolling.</p>
<p>These prices are assuming </p>
  <ol>
    <li>You have help docs already written which will be used as scripts</li>
    <li>You have a version of your application where videos can be easily recorded without interference.</li>
  </ol>
<p>If the above is not the case extra fees will be charged.</p>
<p>I reserve the right to turn down clients or charge extra if I believe videos will require extra work.</p>
<p>Need a lot of videos? You may be eligible for a bulk discount. TODO: Bulk discount pricing list (10% after 10 videos, 20% off after 20 videos, etc.)</p>
<p>Videos are a minute or less. For longer videos each minute counts as a video (we recommend your videos should stay under one minute however).</p>
