Hey, I'm Tyler Dimon. I'm also a sophomore in college at the University of Texas at Dallas majoring in Computer Science. I grew up in Dallas, TX so you may notice an accent.

I worked as an intern at <a href="https://sifterapp.com">Sifter</a> for about 3 years doing all sorts of things. My boss and brother, Garrett, had always wanted videos showing off Sifter's features and eventually for the help docs but could never justify spending his time creating them so I ended up with the job and that's where I made my first videos to show off some of Sifter's features.

I quickly realized that videos were no easy task, and I understood why Garrett could never justify spending his own valuable time on these videos. We also realized that while there are plenty of companies that will make whatever video you want for thousands of dollars, we couldn't find a company that could make a large number of quick videos for an affordable price because it just wasn't worth their time, they had bills to pay.

Being a college student I didn't need much money and am able to make videos that don't break the bank, we wuickly came to the realization that this could be a great opportunity.

I've made x videos, spent x hours, talk about hour Sifter was selling and I needed something new
