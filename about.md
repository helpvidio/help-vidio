Hey, I'm Tyler Dimon.

I've been an intern at <a href="https://sifterapp.com">Sifter</a> for over 3 years now. I'm also a sophomore in college at the University of Texas at Dallas majoring in Computer Science. I grew up in Dallas, TX and I probably sound like I did.

During my internship I've done a lot of miscellaneous things, one being create tutorial videos which we've used on our product page, in feature announcements, and in our help docs. For some reason, I enjoyed making the videos, and even more enjoy seeing them finished and live on Sifter because to me watching a video is so much easier than reading text.

Why make videos at all?

There's three places I think videos can be useful for anyone software company. The product page, feature announcements, and help docs.

The reason for utilizing videos on your product page is because some people just don't like having to scroll around and read your product page. If someone makes it all the way to your product page only to leave because they don't feel like reading, you just lost a potential customer that you got 90% of the way. A quick video however is hard to turn down for even the least interested customers, giving you a chance to hook that customer you wouldn't have otherwise.

A lot of software success happens through word of mouth. We all have too many blog posts that we want to read, so when we find one and all it announces is a new feature, at least for me, it goes to the bottom of the priority list. However if a feature is announced through a quick video I'm far more likely to drop what I'm doing for a minute and check it out. On top of that video is just a way better format for showing off your app, a blog post just doesn't display the interface like a video.

Lastly videos are useful in help docs. Videos make it hard not to understand what's going on, whereas text can leave room for misinterpretation or confusion. With videos your customers are more likely to get it and have a pleasant experience getting it. You know what this mean? Less support requests. I think we all know the advantage of that.

Why not make them yourself?

Because your time is more valuable and should spent on other things. The upfront cost of screen recording and video editing software along with a microphone will cost as much as your first video.

Assuming you have no real prior video making experience beyond dabbling around in iMovie, the time spent getting a hang of an efficient workflow and getting good at making these videos just is not worth it for someone who gets paid what software developers do nowadays.

If you get paid $30 an hour, pay someone to mow your lawn for $20 and spend the hour where you would be mowing your lawn working. You just came out $10 ahead, that is unless you like mowing lawns.
